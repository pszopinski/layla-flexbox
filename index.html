        <h1>Hi, I'm Layla Flexbox</h1>
        <p>
          Born in the late 2000s, I've always been a fan of keeping things
          organized and in perfect alignment. Let's take a journey through my
          life and discover why I'm the go-to choice for layouting on the web.

        <h2>Evolution of Layout Techniques</h2>
        <p>
          In the past, web layouting was a real challenge. It was like trying to
          solve a puzzle with mismatched pieces. People used tables, floats, and
          other hacks to achieve their desired layouts. It was like the wild
          west of web design. But then, I came along.

          In the early 2010s, major browsers started recognizing my potential.
          They began supporting me, making it easier for developers to create
          flexible and responsive layouts. It was an exciting time for the web,
          and I was at the forefront of this revolution.
